**Acne Dataset Fine-tuned:**

* This dataset includes 2436 images. 
* Annotations will be done by Amar and Vivek, each 1200 images. 
* Remaining 36 images, I will be labelling as examples.
* Annotations are to be done for following mentioned classes ( 3 classes for first iteration).
* Annotations are to be completed within 4 days of assignment, i.e. submission by July 11, 2023.
* First batch uploaded on July 5, 2023.

For Iteration 1, annotate following classes:

**0 - Acne** : bumpy, small-big, white-brown cysts with no-redness, NOT RED.

**1 - Pimple** :  bumpy, small-big, red-white cysts, any red big bump, MUST BE RED.

**2 - Spots** : flat, small, circular, dark brown. 


For Iteration 2, annotate following classes:

**3 - Mole1** : flat/black/small/concentrated (til type Moles)

**4 - Mole2** : bumpy/black/dark-brown (Mussa type Moles)

**5 - Scar** : FLAT/ ANY SHAPE/ ANY SHADE

***NOTE:***
> 1. Freckles: if too many freckles are present on the face, remove the image from the project, save it in a separate folder locally to be used later when need arise.
> 2. Moles: if any moles are confusing and similar to spots definition, mark it as spot.
> 3. Scars: for cuts/scars on face, if they are darker shade, circular, and small in size and look similar to spot, mark it as spot.

***For now DO NOT annotate Moles, Bindi or Piercing, if we need, we add it later.***
				
**4 - Bindi** :  any small circular colored painting/sticker on the forehead center.

**5 - Piercing** :  any peircing that is on the face, nose or eyebrows, or lips.
